# Kommunist Desktop Environment

This section is still being planned out. It is not meant to be confused with KDE (K Desktop Environment) or cause negative attention towards it, it is simple tongue and cheek humor. I personally really love KDE, and prefer it over GNOME, but haven't been able to make the switch yet due to some issues on my end.
