# Logo request

I have plans to use a specialized KDE logo for this project. It will be based on the following image:

[/K.D.E/Logo_Request/20071202154045!KDE_logo3.svg](/K.D.E/Logo_Request/20071202154045!KDE_logo3.svg)

But the blue will be replaced with red, and the white will be replaced with yellow, while keeping the gradient consistent.
